INTRODUCTION
The emulatur is an emu-themed recipe book. This is a deviation from its original design, which was an app in which the user can verbally 
interact with the program by asking questions and the system respond to keywords. The information generated is central around animal facts,
ie. the user requests facts about animals, and the system display the relevant information based on some keywords.

However, due to ability and time constraint, this app has been changed to a website/web app and does not support user's verbal interaction.

This idea was inspired by the Japanese YouTube channel, Cooking with Dog, which is a cooking channel with mascot poodle Frances.
Therefore, the design and presentation around this recipe book is animal-themed.

THE PROGRAM
The program has a main page, which is the home page, and its design is in the likeness of an emu's face. This is in line with the idea of
cooking with an animal-partner. In this case, this partner gives the user culinary ideas to attempt in the kitchen.
This page consists heavily of visual elements, and few words (at first glance).
The various components are intended for user interaction, ie. clicking/dragging/animating to reveal information.

Additional pages are pages that contain the chosen recipe.
The idea is that the user is initially greeted with the home page. From here the user selects one of 4 categories:
  - Breakfast
  - Lunch
  - Dinner
  - Dessert

A selection will direct the user to another page that contains an archive of recipes pertaining to the chosen category.
Further selection will direct user to the main page that displays the recipe, and other information regarding the dish.

THE COMPONENTS
The header of the webpage will contain the Mouth, Eyes and Hair visual elements, as well as an option to return to home page (if on
another page).

Mouth - Clicking will toggle the mouth to display the 4 categories.
Eyes - Indicates the spiciness of the dish (range from green-red).
Hair - Hovering will reveal information regarding the dish, eg) vegan, gluten-free, optional ingredients, etc.

The program should allow user to upload new recipes, or delete existing ones.

Additional features to consider is allowing different animal themes, or creating the original mobile app version. Of course, these will be
considered if time permits.
